Communications protocols other than the ASTM protocol

Note In the Protocol area, ASTM protocol uses 8-bit, single-byte
characters. ASTM protocol does not support UNICODE characters

Using ASTM protocol and sending non-8 bit ASCII values in the records to
the instrument causes invalid data in those fields

Physical Layer for TCP/IP Connection


###Each ASTM record is a variable length
record terminated by a carriage return character (<CR>).

For a complete description of the ASTM data link layer, see ASTM
document E1381-95. This ASTM document explains ASTM data link layer
protocol phases, message formats, timing constraints, restricted
characters, error recovery, and a state transition diagram


The ASTM communications protocol uses a standard RS-232
